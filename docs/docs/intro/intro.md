# 👋🏼 Getting Started

## 🏹 Requirements

- `react-native` >= 0.62.0
- `reanimated` >= 2
- `react-native-gesture-handler` >= 1.10.3
- `typescript` >= 4.1.0 (if you use TypeScript)
- `expo` >= 41 (if you use Expo)

## 🚀 Installation

```shell
yarn add react-native-notificated
```

:::info
Starting from the latest beta version (0.0.2.beta), you are expected to manually tell the library whether a device has notch or not. Use the `isNotch` prop in the config for it (you can use the `react-native-device-info` for instance).

We are currently working on improving this part of our API 💪
